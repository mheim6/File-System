# File-System

Implementing a file-system using FUSE.
Design and implement a file-system that runs in memory but that can be initialized from and written back to a backup-file. The file-system is based on FUSE, through the provided file myfs.c. Implemented the 13 operations that are stubbed out in the provided boilerplate file implementation.c. Once everything worked, we run a test- ing campaign, playing with the different operations, their error conditions and, of course, with mounting, unmounting, remounting the file-system. We use different use-cases implying the --size option of myfs.
